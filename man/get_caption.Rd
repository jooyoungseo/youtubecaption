\title{Obtaining YouTube video caption/subtitle in a tidy tibble form.}
\usage{
get_caption(url = NULL, savexl = FALSE, openxl = FALSE, path = ".")
}
\arguments{
\item{url}{A string value for a single YouTube video link URL. A typical form should start with "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=" followed by a unique video ID.}

\item{savexl}{A logical value for determining whether or not to save the obtained tidy YouTube caption data as an Excel file. The default is FALSE which does not save it as a file. If set to TRUE, a file named "YouTube_caption_\code{videoID}.xlsx" is saved in your specified directory (the default is your current working directory).}

\item{openxl}{A logical value for determining whether or not to open, if any, the saved YouTube_caption Excel file in your working directory. The default is FALSE. TRUE works only when the preceding argument (i.e., savexl) is set to TRUE.}

\item{path}{A character vector of full path names; the default corresponds to the working directory, \link[base]{getwd}. Tilde expansion (see \link[base]{path.expand}) is performed. Missing values will be ignored.}
}
\value{
tibble (advanced data.frame) object for a YouTube video caption will be returned.

# Save the caption as an Excel file and open it right it away
